# User Account System - Etendy Image Generator

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive user account system for your Etendy image generator that allows users to sign in with Google and access detailed account information, preferences, and statistics.

## Features Implemented

### üîê Authentication
- **Google OAuth Integration**: Users can sign in with their Google accounts
- **Dual User Types**: Support for both regular users and admin users
- **Persistent Sessions**: User sessions are maintained across browser refreshes
- **Secure Logout**: Clean logout functionality that clears all user data

### üë§ User Profile System
- **Account Information**: Display user's name, email, account creation date, and last login
- **User Avatar**: Shows Google profile picture with fallback initials
- **Admin Badge**: Special badge for admin users
- **Profile Management**: Easy access to account details through a dedicated panel

### ‚öôÔ∏è User Preferences
- **Theme Settings**: Dark theme preference (expandable for light theme)
- **Canvas Defaults**: Default canvas size preferences (square, landscape, portrait, custom)
- **Font Preferences**: Default font family and size settings
- **Export Settings**: Preferred image format (PNG, JPG, WebP) and compression quality
- **Behavioral Settings**: Auto-save, tutorials, email notifications toggles
- **Persistent Storage**: All preferences are saved to Supabase and synced across devices

### üìä User Statistics
- **Images Generated**: Track total number of images created
- **Downloads**: Count of image downloads
- **Templates Created**: Number of custom templates saved
- **Activity Tracking**: Last login time and account creation date
- **Real-time Updates**: Statistics update automatically as users interact with the app

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Beautiful glass-panel design consistent with your app
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in animations and smooth transitions
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tabbed interface for easy access to different sections
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success messages, and error handling

## Database Schema

The system uses two main tables in Supabase:

### `user_preferences`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
- preferences (JSONB) - Stores all user preferences
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

### `user_stats`
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- user_id (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
- images_generated (Integer)
- templates_created (Integer)
- total_downloads (Integer)
- last_login (Timestamp)
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script from `database/user_profile_tables.sql`
4. This will create the necessary tables, RLS policies, and triggers

### 2. Google OAuth Configuration
Your Google OAuth is already configured, but ensure:
1. Your Supabase project has Google OAuth enabled
2. The redirect URLs are properly configured
3. Your Google Cloud Console project has the correct authorized domains

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your environment:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **New Users**: Click "Sign In" ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí Account automatically initialized
2. **Returning Users**: Automatically authenticated on page load
3. **Profile Access**: Click user icon ‚Üí View/edit profile, preferences, and stats
4. **Activity Tracking**: Downloads and image generation automatically tracked

### Admin vs Regular Users
- **Admins**: Access to admin panel + user profile features
- **Regular Users**: Access to user profile, preferences, and personal stats
- **Guests**: Can use the app but no data persistence or tracking

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Handled by Supabase Auth with Google OAuth
2. **Profile Initialization**: Automatic setup of default preferences and stats
3. **Real-time Updates**: Stats update immediately when users perform actions
4. **Preference Sync**: Changes saved instantly and applied across sessions

## Key Components

### `UserProfile.jsx`
- Main profile component with tabbed interface
- Handles profile display, preferences editing, and stats visualization
- Integrates with Supabase for data persistence

### `userService` (in supabase.js)
- Handles all user-related database operations
- Manages preferences and statistics
- Provides helper functions for common operations

### Enhanced `ImageGenerator.jsx`
- Integrated user authentication state management
- Automatic activity tracking
- User-specific UI elements and functionality

## Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own data
- Automatic policy enforcement at the database level
- Protection against unauthorized data access

### Data Validation
- Input validation on all user preferences
- Safe JSON handling for complex preference objects
- Error handling for all database operations

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Social Features**: Share designs with other users
2. **Cloud Storage**: Save designs to user's cloud storage
3. **Collaboration**: Multi-user editing capabilities
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage analytics and insights
5. **Subscription Management**: Premium features and billing integration
6. **Export History**: Track and re-download previous exports

### Technical Improvements
1. **Offline Support**: Cache preferences for offline use
2. **Real-time Sync**: Live updates across multiple browser tabs
3. **Advanced Preferences**: More granular customization options
4. **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and caching strategies

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Google sign-in works correctly
- [ ] User profile displays accurate information
- [ ] Preferences save and persist across sessions
- [ ] Statistics update when performing actions
