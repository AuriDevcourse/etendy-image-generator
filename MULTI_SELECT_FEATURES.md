# Multi-Select and Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented three powerful canvas editing features for the Etendy image generator:
1. **Ctrl+Z Undo** - Keyboard shortcut for undo functionality
2. **Ctrl+Click Multi-Select** - Select multiple elements by holding Ctrl
3. **Ctrl+G Grouping** - Group selected elements to move them together

---

## Features

### 1. Ctrl+Z Undo ‚å®Ô∏è
**Usage:** Press `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Z` (Mac) to undo the last action.

**Details:**
- Works with the existing history system (30 steps max)
- Respects admin settings for undo permissions
- Prevents default browser behavior
- Restores all canvas state including elements, background, and overlays

**Implementation:**
- Added keyboard event listener in `ImageGenerator.jsx`
- Calls `handleUndo()` function when Ctrl+Z is pressed
- Checks `adminSettings.generalControls.undoEnabled` before executing

---

### 2. Ctrl+Click Multi-Select üñ±Ô∏è
**Usage:** 
- Click an element to select it (single selection)
- Hold `Ctrl` and click to add/remove elements from selection
- Click empty space to deselect all

**Visual Feedback:**
- Selected elements show blue dashed borders
- Multiple elements can be selected simultaneously
- Resize handles only appear for single element selection

**Details:**
- Changed state from `selectedElementId` (single) to `selectedElementIds` (array)
- Updated all components to handle array-based selection
- Canvas rendering shows selection boxes for all selected elements
- Layers panel highlights all selected layers

**Implementation:**
- Modified `handleMouseDown` in `CanvasPreview.jsx` to detect Ctrl key
- Toggle selection: if already selected, deselect; otherwise add to selection
- Updated `drawCanvas` to iterate over `selectedElementIds` array

---

### 3. Ctrl+G Grouping üîó
**Usage:** 
- Select 2 or more elements
- Press `Ctrl+G` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+G` (Mac) to group them
- Grouped elements move together as one unit

**Details:**
- Creates a unique `groupId` for all selected elements
- Grouped elements maintain their individual properties
- When dragging one element in a group, all group members move together
- Groups persist through undo/redo operations
- Console logs confirm successful grouping

**Implementation:**
- Added `handleGroupElements()` function in `ImageGenerator.jsx`
- Assigns same `groupId` to all selected elements
- Modified drag logic to detect and move entire groups
- Group detection in `handleMouseDown` checks for shared `groupId`

---

## Technical Changes

### State Management
**Before:**
```javascript
const [selectedElementId, setSelectedElementId] = useState(null);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const [selectedElementIds, setSelectedElementIds] = useState([]);
const [ctrlPressed, setCtrlPressed] = useState(false);
```

### Files Modified

- Changed `selectedElementId` ‚Üí `selectedElementIds` (array)
- Added `ctrlPressed` state tracking
- Added keyboard event listeners for Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+G
- Updated `handleElementSelection` to work with arrays
- Updated `addElement`, `removeElement`, `handleUndo` functions
- Added `handleGroupElements` function
- Updated all child component props

#### 2. **CanvasPreview.jsx**
- Updated props to accept `selectedElementIds` array
- Modified `drawCanvas` to render selection for multiple elements
- Updated `handleMouseDown` for Ctrl+Click multi-select logic
- Added group drag support in `handleMouseMove`
- Updated Delete key handler to remove all selected elements
- Added local Ctrl key tracking

#### 3. **LayersPanel.jsx**
- Changed prop from `selectedElementId` to `selectedElementIds`
- Updated selection highlighting to check array inclusion

#### 4. **Step2_Image.jsx**
- Changed props to `selectedElementIds` and `setSelectedElementIds`
- Updated image selection logic to use arrays

#### 5. **Step3_Text.jsx**
- Changed props to `setSelectedElementIds`
- Updated text layer selection to use arrays

#### 6. **Step4_Elements.jsx**
- Changed props to `setSelectedElementIds`
- Updated shape selection to use arrays

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` | Undo | Undo the last action |
| `Ctrl+G` / `Cmd+G` | Group | Group selected elements together |
| `Ctrl+Click` | Multi-Select | Add/remove element from selection |
| `Delete` | Delete | Delete all selected elements |
| `Click` | Select | Select single element (clears previous selection) |
| `Click Empty Space` | Deselect | Clear all selections |

---

## Group Behavior

### Creating Groups
1. Select multiple elements using Ctrl+Click
2. Press Ctrl+G to group them
3. Console shows: `‚úÖ Grouped X elements with ID: group_TIMESTAMP`

### Moving Groups
- Click any element in a group to select it
- Drag to move all group members together
- Group members maintain relative positions

### Group Properties
- Each element keeps its own properties (color, size, rotation, etc.)
- Elements are linked by a shared `groupId` property
- Groups persist through save/load operations

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Text Input Protection**: Keyboard shortcuts don't trigger when typing in input fields
2. **Single Selection Resize**: Resize handles only show when exactly one element is selected
3. **Empty Selection**: Clicking empty space clears all selections
4. **Delete Multiple**: Delete key removes all selected elements at once
5. **Undo After Group**: Grouping is recorded in history and can be undone
6. **Admin Permissions**: Undo respects admin settings for undo enabled/disabled

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Ctrl+Z undoes last action
- [ ] Ctrl+Click selects multiple elements
- [ ] Ctrl+G groups selected elements
- [ ] Grouped elements move together
- [ ] Delete removes all selected elements
- [ ] Resize handles only show for single selection
- [ ] Selection persists across panel changes
- [ ] Layers panel highlights selected elements
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts don't interfere with text input
- [ ] Undo/redo works with grouped elements

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Ctrl+Shift+G**: Ungroup elements
- **Ctrl+A**: Select all elements
- **Ctrl+D**: Duplicate selected elements
- **Arrow Keys**: Nudge selected elements by 1px
- **Shift+Arrow Keys**: Nudge by 10px
- **Ctrl+C/V**: Copy and paste elements
- **Visual Group Indicator**: Show group boundaries with different color
- **Group Naming**: Allow users to name groups
- **Nested Groups**: Support groups within groups

---

## Notes

- All keyboard shortcuts use `e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey` to support both Windows/Linux (Ctrl) and Mac (Cmd)
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- No breaking changes to the API or data structure
- Groups are stored as a simple `groupId` property on elements
- The feature is fully integrated with the existing undo/history system
